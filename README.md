# AI-for-CardioVascular-Diseases
The aim of this project is to build an expert system which provides systematic approach for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases based on inputs of heart conditions and lab tests.
The final target is to provide suggested treatment(s) for the diagnosed disease. 
Understanding, analyzing, and using the data to arrive at some conclusion play a vital role in creating an efficient Artificial Intelligence. 
This project is a survey, study work and C++ implementation of Backward Chaining and Forward Chaining algorithms, the two key principles of inference engine in expert system.
